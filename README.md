#  Inventory & Order Management System  

This project is a **RESTful backend** for an **Inventory & Order Management System** built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Security (JWT)**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
It helps businesses manage products, suppliers, customers, and stock operations with a clean, scalable backend architecture.  

---

##  Features

###  Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication** for secure login and registration.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** — `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, and `STAFF`.
- All sensitive endpoints are secured and require valid JWT tokens.

###  Inventory Management
- Manage **products** with details like SKU, category, price, and reorder level.
- **Inventory alerts** are automatically triggered when stock drops below a threshold.
- Real-time tracking of stock transactions (inbound and outbound).

###  Supplier & Customer Management
- Manage suppliers and customers with full CRUD functionality.
- Maintain important contact information and relationship records.

###  Order & Transaction Management
- Create and manage customer orders and supplier purchases.
- Automatically adjust product stock based on transactions.
- Maintain full history of stock movements (in/out).

###  Audit & Alert System
- **AuditLog** keeps track of important actions with user and timestamp.
- **InventoryAlert** notifies when a product’s quantity falls below its reorder level.

###  Additional Highlights
- Centralized **Global Exception Handling** for consistent API error responses.
- Uses **DTOs + MapStruct Mappers** for clean, layered architecture.
- Built with scalability and production readiness in mind.

##  Architecture Overview

The project follows a **modular, layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

    class User {
        +Long id
        +String username
        +String email
        +String role
    }

    class Product {
        +Long id
        +String name
        +String sku
        +int quantity
        +int reorderLevel
    }

    class Supplier {
        +Long id
        +String name
        +String contact
    }

    class Customer {
        +Long id
        +String name
        +String email
        +String phone
    }

    class Order {
        +Long id
        +LocalDateTime orderDate
        +String status
    }

    class OrderItem {
        +Long id
        +int quantity
        +double price
    }

    class StockTransaction {
        +Long id
        +String type
        +int quantity
        +LocalDateTime date
    }

    class AuditLog {
        +Long id
        +String action
        +String performedBy
        +LocalDateTime timestamp
    }

    class InventoryAlert {
        +Long id
        +String message
        +boolean resolved
    }
